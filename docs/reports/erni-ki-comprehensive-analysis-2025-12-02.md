ИТОГОВЫЙ ОТЧЕТ ПО АУДИТУ Теперь составлю полный отчет по аудиту проекта
DIZ-admin/erni-ki: 📋 Comprehensive Audit Report: ERNI-KI Project Date:
2025-12-02 Auditor: Claude Code Project: DIZ-admin/erni-ki Version: v0.6.3 ✅
Executive Summary Overall, the ERNI-KI project demonstrates professional-grade
quality with excellent DevOps practices, security measures, and comprehensive
documentation. The codebase is well-maintained with modern tooling and follows
industry best practices in most areas. Key Strengths: Zero npm vulnerabilities
Comprehensive CI/CD with CodeQL security scanning Excellent Docker configuration
with 4-tier logging strategy Extensive documentation (321 markdown files)
Pre-commit hooks configured Critical Issues Found: 2 High Priority Issues: 5
Medium Priority Issues: 8 Low Priority Issues: 3 🔴 Critical Issues

1. README.md Language Violation Severity: Critical File: README.md The main
   README is written entirely in Russian, violating the project's "English-only"
   policy for code and documentation. Impact: Reduces accessibility for
   international contributors Inconsistent with project standards Contradicts
   CLAUDE.md guidelines Recommendation: Translate README.md to English or move
   Russian content to docs/de/README.md and create English version.
2. Missing Environment Configuration Examples Severity: Critical Files: env/
   directory The README.md:31 instructs users to run cp env/\*.example env/,
   but: The env/ directory doesn't exist in the repository No .example or
   .template files found Impact: New users cannot complete setup
   Documentation-reality mismatch Poor onboarding experience Recommendation:
   Create env/ directory with .example files Update .gitignore:12-14 patterns
   are correct Verify all services have corresponding .env.example files 🟠 High
   Priority Issues
3. Outdated Go Dependencies Severity: High Location: auth/go.mod, go.mod 16 Go
   packages have available updates: prometheus/client_golang: v1.19.1 → v1.23.2
   prometheus/common: v0.48.0 → v0.67.4 prometheus/procfs: v0.12.0 → v0.19.2
   DEPRECATED: github.com/golang/protobuf v1.5.0 Recommendation: cd auth go get
   -u github.com/prometheus/client_golang go get -u github.com/prometheus/common

# Replace deprecated protobuf with google.golang.org/protobuf

go mod tidy 4. Dockerfile Comments in Russian Severity: High Files:
auth/Dockerfile:1-65 Several Dockerfiles contain Russian comments (e.g., "Этап
1: Сборка приложения"). Recommendation: Translate all comments to English for
consistency. 5. Python Docker Image Version Not Pinned Severity: High File:
conf/webhook-receiver/Dockerfile:2 Using python:3.11-slim instead of specific
patch version like python:3.11.9-slim. Impact: Potential breaking changes from
automatic minor updates Reduced build reproducibility Recommendation: FROM
python:3.11.9-slim 6. .gitignore Comments in Russian Severity: Medium-High File:
.gitignore:1-50 All section headers and comments are in Russian (e.g.,
"ПЕРЕМЕННЫЕ ОКРУЖЕНИЯ И СЕКРЕТЫ"). Recommendation: Translate to English for
international collaboration. 7. Gitleaks Not Installed Severity: Medium-High
.gitleaks.toml exists but gitleaks binary is not installed. Recommendation:

# Install gitleaks

brew install gitleaks # macOS

# or

curl -sSfL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/master/scripts/install.sh |
sh Add to CI/CD if not already present. 🟡 Medium Priority Issues 8. Missing
Test Configuration Files Severity: Medium No pytest.ini or .coveragerc in
project root (only in pre-commit cache). Recommendation: Create project-level
Python test configuration:

# pytest.ini

[pytest] testpaths = tests/python tests/integration python*files = test*_.py
python_classes = Test_ python*functions = test*\* addopts = --verbose --cov=.
--cov-report=html --cov-report=term 9. Health Monitor Script Evolution Severity:
Low-Medium Files: scripts/health-monitor.sh scripts/health-monitor-v2.sh
scripts/erni-ki-health-check.sh While the wrapper pattern is good practice,
consider: Document migration timeline Set deprecation date (currently mentions
v2 but no removal date) Recommendation: Add deprecation notice to docs with
removal date (e.g., Q2 2025). 10. Limited E2E Test Coverage Severity: Medium
Only 4 E2E tests found for a 30-service production platform:
tests/e2e/mock-openwebui.spec.ts tests/e2e/openwebui-rag.spec.ts
tests/e2e/test-aktennotiz-upload.spec.ts tests/e2e/upload-test.spec.ts
Recommendation: Add E2E tests for: Authentication flows (JWT service) Monitoring
stack (Prometheus/Grafana) Backup/restore procedures (Backrest) Critical user
journeys 11. German Documentation Incomplete Severity: Medium German
translations: 87 files in docs/de/ English docs: 55 files in docs/en/ Total
docs: 321 files Many documents exist only in one language. Recommendation:
Prioritize critical docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, architecture) for translation
Add translation status matrix to documentation 12. No Dependabot Configuration
Visible Severity: Medium While GitHub Actions use latest versions, no visible
Dependabot configuration found. Recommendation: Create .github/dependabot.yml:
version: 2 updates:

- package-ecosystem: "npm" directory: "/" schedule: interval: "weekly"
- package-ecosystem: "docker" directory: "/" schedule: interval: "weekly"
- package-ecosystem: "gomod" directory: "/auth" schedule: interval: "weekly"

13. Docker Compose File Missing Severity: Medium compose.yml was read
    successfully but doesn't exist at expected path. Recommendation: Verify
    Docker Compose file location and update documentation if needed.
14. Pre-commit Hook Coverage Unclear Severity: Medium .pre-commit-config.yaml
    exists but couldn't verify all lint/security hooks. Recommendation: Document
    all pre-commit hooks in CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions.
15. No CODEOWNERS File Found Severity: Medium For a production project with
    governance docs, CODEOWNERS helps with PR review assignment. Recommendation:
    Create .github/CODEOWNERS:

# Default owners for everything

- @DIZ-admin/erni-ki-core

# Infrastructure and security

/scripts/infrastructure/ @DIZ-admin/security-team /conf/nginx/
@DIZ-admin/security-team /.github/workflows/ @DIZ-admin/devops-team

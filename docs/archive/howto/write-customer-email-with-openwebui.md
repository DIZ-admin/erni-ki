# Write a customer email with Open WebUI

## When to use this

Use this guide when you need a polite, concise reply to a customer request and
want to draft it faster with AI. Check the
[status page](../../operations/core/status-page.md) first if responses seem
delayed.

## Step-by-step

1. Open Open WebUI and sign in.
2. Pick the company-approved model for customer communications.
3. Paste the customer request and ask for a draft reply.
4. Review tone and correctness, then copy the draft into your email client.
5. Add any required disclaimers or ticket IDs before sending.

## Example prompts

-**Good:**"You are a customer support agent. Task: draft a polite reply to this
request. Context: the user wants a delivery date. Constraints: keep it under 120
words, avoid technical jargon. Format: bullet points plus a final paragraph.
Request: <paste request>." -**Good:**"Role: account manager. Task: write a short
follow-up confirming we received the documents. Context: project KI-042,
deadline Friday. Constraints: friendly but concise. Output: 3
sentences." -**Avoid:**"Just write something fast" (too vague) or sharing
confidential data without checking policies
(<INSERT INTERNAL POLICY LINK HERE>).

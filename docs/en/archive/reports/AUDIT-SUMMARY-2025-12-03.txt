[WARN] Small team - scalability risk (mitigated by automation, solvable with hiring)
[WARN] No Kubernetes yet - only Docker Compose (roadmap exists, 3-6 months)
[WARN] Test coverage gaps - Bun env issues закрыты; добавить метрики покрытия
[WARN] No customers yet - unproven market fit (need pilot customers)
[WARN] Missing enterprise features - multi-tenancy, advanced RBAC, SSO (roadmap)

RED FLAGS (Critical Issues)
----------------------------
[CRIT] NONE - No critical blockers identified [OK]

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX
----------------------
Priority: HIGH | Timeline: before demo

1. Test Failures (Bun compatibility) — [OK] Fixed
   - Added process.env polyfill in tests/setup.ts, ensured global test utils.
   - bun test / bun run test:unit / bun run test:e2e:mock all green.

2. Missing Dockerfile in root — [OK] Documented (compose-driven)
   - Strategy: compose-driven build from per-service Dockerfile; no root image.
   - Documented in docs/deployment/production-checklist.md (compose build + auth image build).

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
----------------------
1. Best-in-class documentation (330+ pages, 3 languages)
2. Production-ready out of the box (34 microservices, full automation)
3. Security-first architecture (5 scanners, daily audits)
4. Complete observability (metrics, logs, alerts, dashboards)
5. Open-source foundation (no vendor lock-in)
6. Privacy-first (on-premise deployment, GDPR ready)
7. DevOps excellence (7 CI/CD pipelines, 121 scripts)

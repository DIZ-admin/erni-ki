## 12. Recommendations

### For starting the project from scratch:

1. **Start with MVP (6 months, 570K CHF)**
   - Prove concept
   - Validate requirements
   - Fast feedback loop

2. **Iterate to Production (additional 4 months, +800K CHF)**
   - Scale based on real feedback
   - Add enterprise features incrementally
   - Minimize risks

3. **Hybrid approach**
   - Use managed services where possible (DB, monitoring)
   - Customize only critical components
   - Cloud-first for dev/staging, on-premise for production

### Critical success factors:

✅ **Strong architectural expertise** — Solution Architect is critical ✅
**DevOps automation** — CI/CD from day 1 ✅ **Security by design** — not an
afterthought ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** — knowledge must be shared ✅
**Agile methodology** — iterative delivery, not waterfall ✅ **Stakeholder
buy-in** — executive support and clear ROI

## 13. Conclusion

**The ERNI-KI project** is an enterprise-grade AI platform with **32
microservices** requiring significant investment in both development and
operational support.

### Key figures:

- **Implementation time:** 8-10 months (production-ready)
- **Team:** 20-23 specialists (peak)
- **CapEx (Build):** 1,385,500 CHF
- **OpEx (Annual):** 335,000-397,000 CHF
- **TCO (3 years):** 2.39M CHF

### Alternatives:

- **MVP:** 6 months, 570K CHF — prove concept
- **Cloud-based:** Faster, but +27K/year OpEx
- **Buy commercial:** Cheaper short-term, but vendor lock-in

The project is justified for organizations with **high data security
requirements**, **compliance needs**, and **long-term AI strategy**.

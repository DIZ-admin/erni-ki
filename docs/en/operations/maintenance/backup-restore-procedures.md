# Backup & Restore Procedures (placeholder)

A concise English runbook for backup and restore is pending. Until it is ready:

- Follow [`../backup-guide.md`](../backup-guide.md) for backup strategy and
  validation steps.
- Use the Backrest workflow and service restart guidance in
  [`service-restart-procedures.md`](service-restart-procedures.md) for restores.
- See the RU/DE versions of this page for the full procedure.

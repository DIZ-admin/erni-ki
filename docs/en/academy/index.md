# Academy KI

Learning portal for ERNI colleagues who use Open WebUI and related KI services.
Russian pages stay canonical; this version mirrors the structure so users can
navigate in English.

- **Audience:** product owners, business analysts, support engineers, and anyone
  using Open WebUI.
- **Modules:**
  - **Open WebUI basics** — where to find the service, how to pick a model, how
    to send the first request, how to use templates.
  - **Prompting 101** — role → task → context → format, checklists, and office
    scenarios.
  - **HowTo** — step-by-step guides for emails, meeting summaries, Jira tickets,
    with good/bad prompt examples.
  - **News** — product changes, impact on users, and what to do after updates.
  - **System → Status** — link to the Uptime Kuma dashboard to verify service
    health first.
- **Freshness:** Russian content is the source of truth; translation status is
  tracked per page as `translation_status`.

> Always start with the health check: **[System status](../system/status.md)**.

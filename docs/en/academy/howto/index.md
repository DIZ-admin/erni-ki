# HowTo

The ERNI-KI academy contains a set of guided flows for common knowledge-work
tasks. Each article mirrors the Russian canonical version and adds quick English
checklists so non-Russian speakers can still benefit from the playbook.

The scenarios currently covered are:

-**Customer email**– gather facts, pick the right tone, and deliver clear next
steps. -**Meeting summary**– condense transcripts or chat logs into actionable
notes and owner lists. -**JIRA ticket creation**– turn semi-structured
requirements into ready-to- triage issues.

Each guide includes:

1.**Preparation checklist**– what context to collect before
prompting. 2.**Prompt template**– copy-and-paste friendly structure referencing
the collected facts. 3.**Quality gate**– quick QA to ensure the AI output meets
expectations.
